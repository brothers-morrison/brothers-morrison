### ✨ Welcome To a New Age! The AI renaissance is here ✨

Thanks for taking a moment of your time to review my profile.
About me:

- 👋 I'm excited about
    * AI revolution : ChatGPT, Claude & innovations, etc... aka *"How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Impending Robot Apocalypse"*
    * Automated Farms & Automated Aquaponics
    * Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the press, Freedom of information : as cornerstones of democracy actually working
- 🔭 I’m currently working on : 
    * Python/C#.NET/ASP.NET fullstack + microservice / development, management & systems integration
    * IAC & Containerization : Terraform/Anisible/Docker/Kubernetes + Cloud [GCP, Azure, AWS]
    * IT Big Picture Management: SDLC Service Management, Cybersecurity, Log centralization (Open Search) & App Monitoring (Nagios)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning :
    * AI Prompt Engineering (AIM, OCEAN)
    * PromptFlow (tool)
    * Ralph Loops: w/ Claude-Code & Aider
- 💬 Fun fact: I spent 2+ yrs doing *"Awesome computery stuff"* on a massive hospital ship in Africa
    * Also besides my native English, I also speak Spanish, French, and (a little) Mandarin Chinese
    * Ask me about:
    *    "Sauce is sauce" (all sauces essentially exist to make bland/bad/normal stuff taste better, and at their core, are interchangeable)
          See also: sandwich is sandwich, pizza is pizza, and 'make worse tasting food'
          See also: equiv 'worst tasting' self laws for [social media, drugs, gambling]
    *    "Law as code" (all laws/law systems will eventually be codified into computer code.  When that happens, we'll use developer tools and KPIs for refactoring, measuring the code, debugging it, etc)
    *    All family, political/military/civic/religious leaders, and employers want to bend you (and the focus of your life) into the shape that they need. 
          Some may even say that they have your future, career tragectory, and best interests at heart, but very few humans have ever been motivated by anything but their own direct interests.
